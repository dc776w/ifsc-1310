<p>During the course of this semster I have come to learn a great deal of things. I have figured out how to
create a website and stylize it, but to be real honest I am a Cybersecurity Student and I will not be making
any websites in the course of my career. What I ahve learned is how a website is built adn the layout of it, I ahve learned 
what the terms and tags are. In my career I can now identify the individual pieces within a website instead of not
being abel to understand any part of it. The Java script part is a bit rough for me but otherwise I can easily understand HTML,
CSS, and the images that go with that. I took particular interest in the hyperlinking, flex boxes, and the styling 
that goes along with the webiste to make it all pretty.</p>
<p> Now I have taken the time to reflect on what exactly I may ahve done well, I think that I did nearly every project wel except
the Dragon one. I get that it is one of the final projects, I just don;t know what to say brother. I have 
little creative spirit within me, I can analyse things and come up with unique soltuions all day but when it comes
to building something I just falter. I can read and understand every single part of every assignment you gave me, and my work over the semester reflects that. 
But this last project I just choked up. So all in all I think that I did my coursework and class participation very
well throughout the entire semester. If I had to start over and not progress to getting my Bachelors, which I would bevery upset over, 
I think that I would not take the Academic All Star Scholarship that pays for everyhting and just take 2 or 3 
courses. This schoarlship litteraly pays for everything but they require me to take 5 classes per semster
and I already work 40-60 hours per week on top of being a father. It is litteraly killing me.</p>
<p>Now we have to talk about the reflection part. My family was just amazed at the work I showed them, so not too good feedback there. 
And because of the coronovirus restrictions we take alternating shifts working from home and at the office so 
I don't see my coworkers very much so I had to show my work to some nontechnical coworkers and they were amazed too. 
So I took the feedback you gave me and added in more content, changed a few things here and there, and made some adjustments. 
When I added in the FAQ stuff I kept with the pattern of Slate grey, then White, then Slate Grey, and White again. 
I chose to do this becuase your my teacher and I take what you say seriously. And of course the obvious wanting to 
pass the class and graduate since I'm halfway through getting my bachelors.</p>
